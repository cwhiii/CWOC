# CWOC — Tasks & Roadmap

*Completed items are in `done.md`. Deferred items in `parking_lot.md`. Declined in `path_not_traveled.md`.*


## Manual Tasks
- `[ ]` Screenshot and video walkthrough of the app

---

## Top Priorities


fix habit notifications:

The how it charts are pre-rendering the text. So they're grainy and terrible. Use actual text instead of rendered text from an image for those charts.


## Exporting
- Export chit as markdwon with frontmatter.
- Export chit as calendar file. (.ics)
- Export all chits in either of the above, per user, or all users.




### Health Indicators (Enhancements)

- `[ ]` Symptom tracker (multi-select), with the ability to create your own list of symptoms in settings

- `[ ]` Cycle tracking (show/hide based on gender setting)
---

## Known Bugs

- `[ ]` The reset on the admin tool for users doesn't actually change the password
- `[ ]` The admin should be able to update usernames for existing users
- `[ ]` Ensure the export-all exports everything (is this safe? Are passwords hashed? What about the key for Tailscale?)
- `[ ]` Pruning should be enabled by default
- habits mode: Animation — Ditched the FLIP approach entirely. still doesnt animate after the cahnged compltion values, it jsut instnatly swaps, wihch is hard to follow)

    - Hide all filters other than: 
        - tags, and ensure you're looking at oeopl etags, not chit tags (exolain the differece  & ask for inout hewre ebfeore manking any chges to this)
        - Add a filter for:
            -  contact/user
            - Has: XYZ. (true matches person with ANY value in that field). one for each person field.
            -

### Calendar & Scheduling
- `[ ]` Show alarms/notifications/timers on calendar view
- `[ ]` Jitter for reminders (±X minutes, configurable globally and per-chit)
- `[ ]` Alarm: chained variable-length intervals (5 min, then 4, then 4…)

### Templates
- `[ ]` Save a chit as a template, auto-populate new chits from it

### Calendar Import (.ics)
- `[ ]` Import calendar data from Google, Apple, and Windows/Outlook via .ics files
- One parser covers all three (iCalendar / RFC 5545)
- Field mapping: SUMMARY→title, DESCRIPTION→note, DTSTART/DTEND→dates, LOCATION→location, CATEGORIES→tags, PRIORITY→High/Medium/Low
- Recurrence: map common RRULE patterns to existing `recurrence_rule` format
- VTODO support for Apple Reminders and Outlook Tasks
- Duplicate detection on title + start_datetime
- Estimate: ~400–600 lines backend, ~50–100 lines frontend

### Location

---

## Large / Complex

### Real World Use
- `[ ]` Establish external access path (Home Assistant? Secured reverse proxy? Mobile platform?)
- `[ ]` Security audit

### HST Time Format (Global)
- `[ ]` When "HST" is selected, ALL times display in HST throughout the tool
- `[ ]` Calendar hour columns, event times, tooltips, quick edit, editor — all use HST
- `[ ]` HST displays as plain number (e.g. "42.5 sd") — no progress bar except Clock modal
- `[ ]` Views show 100 HST hours instead of normal hours
- `[ ]` Span options become 1,2,3,4,5,10 HST hours

### Health Indicators (Enhancements)
- `[ ]` Symptom tracker (multi-select), with the ability to create your own list of symptoms in settings
- `[ ]` Cycle tracking (show/hide based on gender setting)

### Data & Infrastructure
- `[ ]` E2E encryption

- `[ ]` Phone app with offline store + sync

### UI & Layout
- `[ ]` Rolling circular chits view (next task in project, repeat when done)
- `[ ]` Automatic Context switching (hide chits by time schedule + tags) via rule

---

## Long-term / Dream

- `[ ]` Email integration (prototype exists)
- `[ ]` Home Assistant integration
- `[ ]` Obsidian sync (auto-export notes as Markdown)
- `[ ]` Object & Inventory Tracking zone
- `[ ]` Reports system
- `[ ]` Automations (if this, then that)
- `[ ]` Appointments (from other people)
- `[ ]` Notification based on start time + location + drive time
- `[ ]` Biometric triggers (steps, heart rate, cycle state)
- `[ ]` Auto backup & export to other machine

---

## Decisions Needed

- `[ ]` Support file attachments on chits?
- `[ ]` Event by quantity of TIME vs chronological (snooze slides the event until started)
- `[ ]` Chit groups (like Google calendars) — just use tags? Maybe a checkbox to "use as group"?
