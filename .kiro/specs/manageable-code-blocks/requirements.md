# Requirements Document — Manageable Code Blocks

## Introduction

This spec defines two coordinated changes to the CWOC codebase:

1. **Directory restructuring** — Organize all source code under a single `src/` top-level directory with logical subdirectories, and flatten the data directory to a top-level `data/` path.
2. **File decomposition** — Split the five largest monolithic files into smaller, focused files so that when something breaks, the relevant code is easy to find.

The five target files for decomposition are `backend/main.py` (~4,500 lines), `frontend/main.js` (~7,300 lines), `frontend/editor.js` (~4,600 lines), `frontend/shared.js` (~5,000 lines), and `frontend/styles.css` (~3,081 lines).

The backend split uses Python's native `import` system. The frontend split uses additional `<script>` tags in the correct load order — no ES modules, no bundlers, no build step. CSS is split into multiple `<link>` tags loaded in order.

This spec builds on the completed codebase-refactor spec (`.kiro/specs/codebase-refactor/`), which reorganized code *within* existing files. This spec restructures the directory layout and splits those files *into* separate files.

## Glossary

- **Decomposition_Engine**: The process that restructures directories and splits monolithic files into smaller focused files while preserving all functionality.
- **Backend**: The FastAPI application, currently in `backend/main.py`, moving to `src/backend/`.
- **Dashboard**: The main page (`index.html` + `main.js` + `styles.css`) with tab views, sidebar, and calendar.
- **Editor**: The chit editor page (`editor.html` + `editor.js` + `editor.css`) with collapsible zones.
- **Shared_JS**: Shared JavaScript utilities (`shared.js`) loaded before page-specific scripts.
- **Script_Load_Order**: The sequence of `<script>` tags in each HTML file, which determines global function availability since there are no ES modules.
- **Module_File**: A Python file within `src/backend/` that is imported by `main.py` to provide a subset of functionality.
- **Sub_Script**: A frontend JavaScript file extracted from a larger file, loaded via an additional `<script>` tag in the correct position.
- **Sub_Stylesheet**: A CSS file extracted from a larger stylesheet, loaded via an additional `<link>` tag in the correct position.
- **System_Tag**: Auto-assigned tags (Calendar, Checklists, Alarms, Projects, Tasks, Notes) based on chit properties.
- **C_CAPTN**: The six dashboard views — Calendar, Checklists, Alarms, Projects, Tasks, Notes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Restructure Project into src/ Directory with Subdirectories

   ```
2. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL flatten the data directory to a top-level `data/` path containing the SQLite database file directly (not nested `data/data/`).
3. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update `DB_PATH` in the backend to reference the correct data directory path.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update the FastAPI `StaticFiles` mounts to serve from the new directory paths:
   - `/frontend/html/` serving HTML files from `src/frontend/html/`
   - `/frontend/js/` serving JS files from `src/frontend/js/`
   - `/frontend/css/` serving CSS files from `src/frontend/css/`
   - `/static/` serving from `src/static/`
5. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update the uvicorn startup command from `uvicorn backend.main:app` to `uvicorn src.backend.main:app` in `start.sh`, `cwoc.service`, and all documentation.
6. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update all `FileResponse` paths in the backend to reference the new HTML file locations.
7. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update all `<script src="...">` and `<link href="...">` paths in every HTML file to reference the new JS and CSS file locations.
8. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update all `window.location.href` and `fetch()` URL references in JavaScript files that point to frontend pages (e.g., `/frontend/editor.html` → `/frontend/html/editor.html`).
9. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL add `__init__.py` files to `src/backend/` and `src/backend/routes/` to make them proper Python packages.
10. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL preserve the `install/` directory and `configurinator.sh` at the project root, updating any paths within them that reference the old directory structure.

### Requirement 2: Split backend/main.py into Python Modules

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend code split into focused Python modules, so that when a route or migration breaks I can locate the problem in a small, specific file instead of scrolling through 4,500 lines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL split `backend/main.py` into the following Module_Files within `src/backend/`:
   - `src/backend/models.py` — all Pydantic model classes (Chit, Settings, Contact, Tag, MultiValueEntry, ImportRequest)
   - `src/backend/db.py` — database initialization (`init_db`), instance ID management, JSON serialization/deserialization helpers (`serialize_json_field`, `deserialize_json_field`), `compute_display_name`, `compute_system_tags`, export envelope builder, version info helpers
   - `src/backend/migrations.py` — all `migrate_*` functions and the contacts table initialization (`init_contacts_table`)
   - `src/backend/routes/chits.py` — all chit-related API route handlers (CRUD, recurrence exceptions)
   - `src/backend/routes/trash.py` — all trash-related API route handlers (list, restore, purge)
   - `src/backend/routes/settings.py` — all settings-related API route handlers
   - `src/backend/routes/contacts.py` — all contact-related API route handlers (CRUD, favorite, image, export, import)
   - `src/backend/routes/audit.py` — audit log route handlers and audit helper functions
   - `src/backend/routes/health.py` — health check, version, instance ID, and WebSocket routes
   - `src/backend/serializers.py` — vCard parser/printer and CSV export/import functions
   - `src/backend/weather.py` — weather API proxy, geocoding proxy, and scheduling helpers
2. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL keep `src/backend/main.py` as the FastAPI app entry point that imports from all Module_Files and registers routes.
3. WHEN `src/backend/main.py` starts, THE Backend SHALL execute all migrations and database initialization in the same order as before the split.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL preserve the `DB_PATH` constant and `_update_lock` as shared state accessible to all Module_Files that need them.
5. IF a Module_File depends on a function or class from another Module_File, THEN THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL use standard Python imports to resolve the dependency.
6. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL preserve all 24+ API endpoints with identical request/response contracts after the split.
7. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure each Module_File is under 500 lines, with the exception of `src/backend/routes/contacts.py` which may be up to 700 lines due to the vCard/CSV import complexity being closely coupled to contact routes.

### Requirement 3: Split frontend/main.js into Focused Sub-Scripts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard JavaScript split into focused files, so that when a calendar view or sidebar feature breaks I can find the relevant code in a small file instead of searching through 7,300 lines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN `index.html` loads, THE Dashboard SHALL include all Sub_Scripts via `<script>` tags after shared scripts and before the coordinator `main.js`.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL preserve all global function names so that `onclick` handlers in `index.html` continue to work without modification to the handler names.
5. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure each Sub_Script is under 1,200 lines.

### Requirement 4: Split frontend/editor.js into Focused Sub-Scripts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the editor JavaScript split into focused files, so that when a specific editor zone breaks I can isolate the problem to a small, zone-specific file.

2. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL keep `editor.js` as a minimal coordinator file that declares shared editor state variables (`chitId`, `currentWeatherLat`, `currentWeatherLon`, `currentWeatherData`, `weatherIcons`, `defaultColors`) and loads after all sub-scripts.
3. WHEN `editor.html` loads, THE Editor SHALL include all Sub_Scripts via `<script>` tags after shared scripts, `shared-editor.js`, `editor_checklists.js`, and `editor_projects.js`, and before the coordinator `editor.js`.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL preserve all global function names so that `onclick` handlers in `editor.html` continue to work without modification to the handler names.
5. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure each Sub_Script is under 800 lines.

### Requirement 5: Split frontend/shared.js into Focused Sub-Scripts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shared utilities split into focused files, so that when a shared helper like calendar drag or tag tree breaks I can find it in a small, topic-specific file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL split `frontend/shared.js` into the following Sub_Scripts under `src/frontend/js/shared/`:

2. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL keep `shared.js` as a minimal coordinator file that loads after all shared Sub_Scripts and provides any remaining glue code.
3. WHEN any HTML page loads shared scripts, THE page SHALL include all shared Sub_Scripts via `<script>` tags before the coordinator `shared.js`, which loads before `shared-page.js` and page-specific scripts.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL preserve all global function names so that callers in dashboard, editor, settings, and other files continue to work without modification.
5. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure `shared-utils.js` loads first among the shared Sub_Scripts since other shared files depend on its utility functions.
6. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure `shared-touch.js` loads before `shared-checklist.js` and `shared-sort.js` since both use `enableTouchDrag`.
7. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure each Sub_Script is under 600 lines.

### Requirement 6: Split frontend/styles.css into Focused Sub-Stylesheets

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard CSS split into focused files, so that when a calendar layout or sidebar style breaks I can find the relevant rules in a small, topic-specific file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL keep `styles.css` as a minimal file that contains only an organizational comment and any rules that do not fit cleanly into the sub-stylesheets.
3. WHEN `index.html` loads, THE Dashboard SHALL include all Sub_Stylesheets via `<link>` tags with `styles-variables.css` loaded first, followed by the other sub-stylesheets in any order, followed by `styles.css` last.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure CSS specificity is preserved — rules that override other rules SHALL remain in the same relative order after the split.
5. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure each Sub_Stylesheet is under 500 lines.

### Requirement 7: Preserve All Existing Functionality

12. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL preserve the `_template.html` page template and `shared-page.js` auto-header/footer injection system.

### Requirement 8: Maintain Script and Stylesheet Load Order Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script and stylesheet load order to be correct in every HTML file, so that global functions and CSS variables are available when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `index.html` loads scripts, THE Dashboard SHALL load them in this order: shared Sub_Scripts (with `shared-utils.js` first) → `shared.js` → `shared-page.js` → dashboard Sub_Scripts → `main.js`.
2. WHEN `editor.html` loads scripts, THE Editor SHALL load them in this order: shared Sub_Scripts (with `shared-utils.js` first) → `shared.js` → `shared-page.js` → `shared-editor.js` → `editor_checklists.js` → `editor_projects.js` → editor Sub_Scripts → `editor.js` → Flatpickr → marked.js.
3. WHEN any secondary page loads scripts, THE page SHALL load shared Sub_Scripts (with `shared-utils.js` first) → `shared.js` → `shared-page.js` → page-specific scripts, preserving the existing load order for page-specific scripts.
4. WHEN `index.html` loads stylesheets, THE Dashboard SHALL load `styles-variables.css` first, then remaining sub-stylesheets, then `styles.css` last.
5. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update ALL HTML files that reference the split files to include the new Sub_Scripts and Sub_Stylesheets in the correct order with the correct paths.
6. IF a Sub_Script defines a function that another Sub_Script calls, THEN THE Sub_Script defining the function SHALL be loaded before the Sub_Script calling it.

### Requirement 9: Preserve Vanilla Architecture Constraints

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the split to respect the project's vanilla JS/HTML/CSS architecture, so that no new tooling or complexity is introduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL use only `<script>` tags for JavaScript loading — no ES modules (`import`/`export`), no bundlers, no transpilers.
2. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL use only `<link>` tags for CSS loading — no CSS `@import` statements, no preprocessors.
3. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL use standard Python `import` statements for backend module splitting — no additional frameworks or tools.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL introduce no new dependencies — no npm, no pip installs, no new CDN libraries.
5. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure all frontend functions remain in the global scope so that `onclick` handlers in HTML continue to work.
6. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure the FastAPI `StaticFiles` mounts serve all new Sub_Scripts and Sub_Stylesheets from the new directory paths.

### Requirement 10: Ensure Each File Has a Clear Single Responsibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each new file to have a clear, documented purpose, so that when something breaks I know exactly which file to look at.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL add a file-level comment block at the top of each new Sub_Script and Sub_Stylesheet describing its purpose, what it contains, and which files depend on it.
2. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL add a file-level docstring at the top of each new Module_File describing its purpose and its relationship to `main.py`.
3. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure no function or CSS rule is duplicated across the new files — each piece of code SHALL exist in exactly one file.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL ensure each file focuses on a single logical concern (e.g., one editor zone, one view type, one API resource group).
5. WHEN a developer encounters a bug in calendar rendering, THE developer SHALL find all calendar-related code in `src/frontend/js/dashboard/main-calendar.js` and `src/frontend/css/dashboard/styles-calendar.css` without needing to search other files.
6. WHEN a developer encounters a bug in a backend contact route, THE developer SHALL find all contact route code in `src/backend/routes/contacts.py` without needing to search other files.

### Requirement 11: Provide a Function and File Index

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reference index that maps every function, class, and CSS section to its file, so that when I need to find or debug something I can look it up instantly instead of guessing which file it lives in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL create a `src/INDEX.md` file that serves as the master reference for the entire codebase.
2. THE Index SHALL contain a **Backend section** organized by Module_File, listing every public function, class, and route handler with a one-line description. Example format:
   ```
   ## Backend
   ### src/backend/models.py
   - `Chit` — Pydantic model for chit records
   - `Settings` — Pydantic model for user settings
   ...
   ### src/backend/routes/chits.py
   - `GET /api/chits` — list all non-deleted chits
   - `POST /api/chits` — create a new chit
   ...
   ```
3. THE Index SHALL contain a **Frontend JS section** organized by directory and file, listing every global function with a one-line description. Example format:
   ```
   ## Frontend JavaScript
   ### src/frontend/js/shared/shared-utils.js
   - `generateUniqueId()` — create a unique ID string
   - `formatDate(date)` — format a Date as YYYY-Mon-DD
   ...
   ### src/frontend/js/dashboard/main-calendar.js
   - `renderWeekView()` — render the 7-day week calendar grid
   ...
   ```
4. THE Index SHALL contain a **Frontend CSS section** organized by directory and file, listing the major rule groups or sections in each stylesheet.
5. THE Index SHALL contain a **Load Order section** documenting the required `<script>` tag order for each HTML page.
6. THE Index SHALL contain a **File Dependency Map** showing which files depend on which other files (e.g., `shared-checklist.js` depends on `shared-utils.js` and `shared-touch.js`).

### Requirement 12: Update Template, Documentation, and Deployment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all templates, documentation, and deployment files updated to reflect the new directory structure, so that new development and deployments work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update `src/frontend/html/_template.html` to include all shared Sub_Scripts in the correct load order with the new paths, and add a comment documenting the required script load order for new pages.
2. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update `start.sh` to use the new uvicorn module path (`src.backend.main:app`).
3. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update `cwoc.service` to use the new uvicorn module path.
4. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update `install/configurinator.sh` to reference the new directory paths.
5. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update `README.md` and `documentation/overview.md` to reflect the new project structure.
6. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update any steering files (`.kiro/steering/`) that reference the old directory paths.
7. WHEN the backend references `/app/VERSION`, THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL preserve that path since it is an absolute production path independent of the source code structure.
8. THE Decomposition_Engine SHALL update all `window.location.href` assignments and `fetch()` URL references in JavaScript that navigate to frontend pages to use the new paths (e.g., `/frontend/html/editor.html`).
